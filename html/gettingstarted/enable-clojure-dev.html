<h1>Enable clojure-dev clojure's support</h1>
<h2>On a new project</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Enable the java perspective via menu Window &gt; Open Perspective
    &gt; Other &gt; Java</li>
    <li>Menu File &gt;New &gt;New Clojure Project</li>
    <li>Enter a project name</li>
    <li>Click finish ... that's it!</li>
</ul>

<h2>On an existing java project</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Display the context menu of the java project node in the project
    explorer</li>
    <li>Select action "Enable/disable clojure language support"</li>
    <li>You should have a popup feedback on the correct enabling/disabling
    of clojure for this project</li>
</ul>

<h2>What does it do</h2>

<p>A clojure project is just a java project, with an added builder for
clojure code.</p>

<p>By default, creating/enabling a clojure project will also check if you
have clojure in your classpath, and if not, will add a dependency on clojure-dev
plugin's own embedded clojure version.</p>

<h2>What can I customize?</h2>

<p>Everything you want as if you were in a classical java project. But you
must of course always have clojure as a dependency of your project, but it can
come in as many flavors as eclipse allows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>clojure source code directly embedded in your project (not
    recommended)</li>
    <li>as another project in your eclipse. You then make the clojure
    project a dependency of you own project (recommanded if you want to keep in
    sync)
    <ul>
        <li>how to?
        <ul>
            <li>First create a classic java project for the source code of
            clojure. You will have to change the default java source folder: you
            must have 2 of them, one will be src/jvm, the other will be src/clj</li>
            <li>In a second project where you enabled clojure's support, do
            Project &gt; Properties &gt; Java build path &gt; Projects &gt; Add
            and add clojure's project</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>as a jarred library. use the classical java mechanism offered by
    eclipse to add this jar to you project ( Project &gt; Properties &gt; Java
    build path &gt; Libraries ...</li>
